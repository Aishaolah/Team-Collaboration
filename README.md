Perceptron-Based Agriculture Decision Support System

This project is a simple Perceptron implementation in C, designed to help farmers decide whether to proceed with planting based on three key factors: weather conditions, soil quality, and access to resources. The Perceptron uses these factors to make a binary decision about whether planting should proceed, with the decision based on weighted inputs compared to a threshold. 


Why This Project?
Farmers have to consider multiple factors when deciding whether to plant crops. This tool helps simplify that decision-making process by using the Perceptron algorithm, which mimics the decision-making process of the human brain. It takes the three inputs and gives a simple recommendation based on these factors.
